# fblogin
Simple file containing basic selenium commands. Program opens firefox and logs into facebook for you.
Fill out the MY_USERNAME and MY_PASSWORD fields for this to work. If you want the program to open in another browser download the appropriate webdriver and place it in your workspace folder if you're using Windows. Then change the code accordingly (there's one line to change).
